Grocery shopping has become easier thanks to the fast expansion in India of ultrafast grocery delivery services including Zepto, Blinkit, and BigBasket. Still, consumers get difficulty in real time comparing product prices. SmartCart, a cuttingedge system meant to offer a central solution for current price comparison across fast commerce platforms, is introduced here. For data collection, the system uses website scraping tools, a backend based on Flask for structured data delivery, and a flexible frontend constructed with CSS and JavaScript. SmartCart also includes an AIdriven chatbot that handles natural language requests, hence giving consumers a smooth, conversational experience. SmartCart enables consumers to make wise, effective, and costefficient choices by normalizing product prices to unit costs as well as combining delivery time estimates. Our assessment shows how well the system accurately matches product prices, provides realtime comparisons, and improves the Indian fast commerce sector's shopping experience.
